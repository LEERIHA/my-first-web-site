      , is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
      World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
      JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often
      incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
      include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
      facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
      JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in
      web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of
      applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
      Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective
      standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
      design.

      The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was
      released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
      prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[12] The
      lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which
      released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This
      quickly became the most-used.[13] During these formative years of the Web,
      web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
      behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in
      the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in
      1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They
      pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to
      embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to
      embed the Scheme language.[6]
