      </a>
      is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
      document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML
      dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology
      of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed
      to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
      colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
      provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
      characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
      specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
      complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
      file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
      share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content
      also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
      for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
      (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
      devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
      accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from the
      specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
      than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
      is predictable.

      CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[23] At the
      time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[24] Several other
      style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and
      discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium
      resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in
      1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became
      co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26] Style sheets
      have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard
      Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to
      provide style sheets for the web.[27] One requirement for a web style
      sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the
      web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were
      not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced
      by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27]
